 ## Changes
 * * HTML Changes 
 * Title page has been change to Horriseon
 * <header> and <nav> has been used to changed the <div> after <body>.
 * class= "content" has been changed in to id instead of class to create a section for the content part of the page.
 * As one of the link is not working I put <div id> to the search-engine-optimization part.
 * In img I add some alt attribute.
 * <aside> was used in the side part section of the code to replace <div>.
 * footer has been set too.

 * * CSS Changes
 * content & benefit was changed from class(.) to id(#).
 * In some of the element I used the element,element selector as they have the same styles anyway to make it cleaner and simplier.
